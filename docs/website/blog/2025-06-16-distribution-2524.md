### Distribution `2524` is now available

The [`2524.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2524.0) distribution has been released, introducing the following changes:

- Support for `Cardano node` `10.4.1` in the signer and the aggregator
- Support for recording client types origin (library, CLI and WASM) in the aggregator metrics.
- **Unstable** Support for UTxO-HD snapshot converter `tools utxo-hd snapshot-converter` command in client CLI.
- **Unstable** Support for partial cardano database restoration in `cardano-database` command with `--backend v2` parameter.
- Bug fixes and performance improvements.

This new distribution has been deployed to the **Mithril aggregator** on the `release-mainnet` and `release-preprod` networks.

If you are running a **Mithril signer**:

- **pre-release-preview** network: no action is required at this time
- **release-preprod** network: upgrade your signer node binary to version `0.2.249` – no configuration updates are required
- **release-mainnet** network: upgrade your signer node binary to version `0.2.249`– no configuration updates are required.

You can update the Mithril signer using the one-line command below. It downloads to the current directory by default, but you can specify a custom folder using the -p option:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh | sh -s -- -c mithril-signer -d 2524.0 -p $(pwd)
```
