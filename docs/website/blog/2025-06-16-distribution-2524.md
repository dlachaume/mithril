### Distribution `2524` is now available

The [`2524.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2524.0) distribution has been released, introducing the following changes:

- Support for Cardano node v.10.4.1 in the signer and aggregator
- Support for recording client origin types (library, CLI, WASM) in aggregator metrics
- **Unstable** support for UTXO-HD snapshot converter `tools utxo-hd snapshot-converter` command in the client CLI
- **Unstable** support for partial Cardano database restoration using the `cardano-database` command with the `--backend v2` parameter
- Bug fixes and performance improvements.

This new distribution has been deployed to the **Mithril aggregator** on the `release-mainnet` and `release-preprod` networks.

If running a **Mithril signer**:

- **pre-release-preview** network: no action required at this time
- **release-preprod** network: upgrade the signer node binary to version `0.2.249` – no configuration changes required
- **release-mainnet** network: upgrade the signer node binary to version `0.2.249`– no configuration changes required.

You can update the Mithril signer using the one-line command below. It downloads to the current directory by default, but you can specify a custom folder using the -p option:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh | sh -s -- -c mithril-signer -d 2524.0 -p $(pwd)
```
